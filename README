How to use:

1) Ensure libsvm is set up (and is in the same directory as DirectoryCombine.py)
2) Ensure that 'fselect.py' is in the 'tools' directory of libsvm
3) Create the 'patgroups.txt' file (in the same directory as DirectoryCombine.py)
4) Create 'testing_patients.txt' file (in the same directory as DirectoryCombine.py)
5) Put all PCR data files into a directory called 'patient_data'
6) Run script



Notes:

1: Convert files to A and B assays
	- Heavy lifting done in filesToAssayArray() and getTargetNamesAndCTs()
	- Process the A and B files separately
	- Identify the target (assay) names and cts using the first file from each list
	- Iterate through each file, get it's target names and cts, look up the target name in the assay list, add the ct to the assay that is found

2: (Normalize between A and B) If there are B files, merge them with the A files (using the U6 assays)
	- First find a reference patient (ex. if 03 is the reference patient, the training data has 03A.txt and 03B.txt)
	- For this reference patient, find the DIFFERENCE between the AVERAGES of the U6 ASSAY CTS for A and B (i.e. Au6Avg - Bu6Avg = adjuster) and call this difference the adjuster
	- For EVERY B assay, increment its cts by the adjuster

3: Find least variant assays
	- Two possible metrics: variance*mean or chi-square (sum of (observed-expected)^2)
	- Candidates for least variant assays must belong to group A and have all their CTs
	- The expected value for a given assay is found by summing the cts over all patients and dividing by the number of patients

4: Assay and CT data structures into Patient and Mir data structures

5: (Normalize within patients) 
	- Choose the 10% of the least variant assays
	- Compute the average ct of these least variant assays and subtract that from all the patient CTs
